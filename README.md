3. Convert Script to Audio (Narration) using Text-to-Speech

We can use a text-to-speech library like gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert the script into audio. Below is an example of how you can do this:

from gtts import gTTS
import os

# Convert script to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)
def generate_audio(script, filename='output_audio.mp3'):
    tts = gTTS(text=script, lang='en')
    tts.save(filename)
    return filename

# Example usage
audio_filename = generate_audio(script)
print(f"Audio file saved: {audio_filename}")

4. Video Assembly: Combining Images, Audio, and Effects

To combine the generated images, audio, and add transitions/effects, we can use the moviepy library. This will allow you to create a video by combining the media files into one final piece.

from moviepy.editor import *
import requests
from io import BytesIO

# Function to create video from images and audio
def create_video(images, audio_file, output_video='final_video.mp4'):
    clips = []
    for img_url in images:
        response = requests.get(img_url)
        img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
        clip = ImageClip(img).set_duration(3)  # Display each image for 3 seconds
        clips.append(clip)

    # Concatenate all image clips into one sequence
    video = concatenate_videoclips(clips, method="compose")

    # Load audio file
    audio = AudioFileClip(audio_file)

    # Set the audio to the video
    video = video.set_audio(audio)

    # Set video resolution and export
    video = video.resize(height=720)  # You can change the resolution here
    video.write_videofile(output_video, codec='libx264', fps=24)

# Example usage: Assuming images and audio are ready
create_video(images, audio_filename)
print("Video creation completed!")

5. Final Touches and Feedback Loop

In this setup, the AI-driven video creation process has a feedback loop to improve the results. Based on user feedback on the generated video, further enhancements can be made:

    User Feedback: After the video is generated, users can provide feedback on various aspects, such as clarity, pacing, and visual appeal.
    Fine-Tuning: Based on feedback, the script generation, image creation, and video editing processes can be fine-tuned to align better with user preferences.

6. Deployment of the AI Video Generator

To deploy this AI video creator in a scalable manner, consider containerizing the solution using Docker or deploying it as a web-based application with a front-end for user interaction.
End-to-End Flow Overview

    User Input: A user provides a topic or concept for the video (e.g., “AI in Healthcare”).
    Script Generation: The GPT model generates a detailed script based on the given input.
    Image/Visual Generation: Using DALL-E or another generative model, relevant visuals are created for different parts of the script.
    Audio Generation: The script is converted to speech using a text-to-speech model (e.g., gTTS).
    Video Assembly: The generated images, audio, and transitions are compiled into a final video using the moviepy library.
    User Feedback Loop: After the video is generated, users can review the video and provide feedback for improvements.

Summary

This Python-based solution integrates generative AI models to produce high-quality videos automatically. The video generation process includes script writing, image creation, text-to-speech audio conversion, and video assembly, all powered by AI models. The final product can be used in a variety of applications, from marketing content creation to educational videos.

You can further improve this by using more sophisticated AI models and incorporating machine learning to optimize video creation based on user interactions and preferences.
